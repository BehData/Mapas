# COVID-19 Peru map with ggplotly [R Package]
The project aims to generate an interactive map using ggplotly, download "Mapa_covid.R" script to review the complementary packpages, functions and objets that hat helped me achieve it.

The main inputs are Peru geometries contained in "BAS_LIM_DEPARTAMENTO.shp", and Peru covid-19 database that i've download in "Plataforma Nacional de Datos Abiertos" (link: https://www.datosabiertos.gob.pe/dataset/casos-positivos-por-covid-19-ministerio-de-salud-minsa). As a result, the map below is shown.

It is clearly visualizated that Lima had the highest number of covid infections, due to its largest population. However, in future versions the contagion density will be analyzed to consider the relationship between population and infections.
